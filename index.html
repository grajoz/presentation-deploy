                   <p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Pavel</p>
<p>I’m going to represent you some info about Angular .</p>
<p>Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML and either JavaScript or a language like TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript . The framework consists of several libraries  . Typescript is more common in the Angular community because Angular itself has been written by Typescript .
Over the past few years various frameworks have been built and evolved to make web application development easier . Angular is the example of such framework . </p>
<p>AngularJS introduces in 2010 as Javascript framework for building client applications. Soon it gets popularity and Angular team started adding new features . Due to needs today’s application Angular team rewrote the original framework using typescript and as a result Angular 2 came out in mid of 2016 .</p>
<p>There rather a lot of differences different the first and the second version of Angular and many developers unhappy because they had a lot of applications built with Angular 1  .   But this new framework is a much cleaner framework and it is a lot easier to understand and to work with .</p>
<p>The benefits of using Angular . At first it gives our application a clear and loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand and easy to maintain . Applications build with Angular are more testable .</p>
<p>Let me show you how it is easy to use Angular .</p>
<p>Then we will need an - Angular CLI . It is a command line tool that we use to create a new angular project</p>
<p>We can create our first project . You see this command when you create new project generates new files and folders for our project . </p>
<p>You can use any  code editor which is familiar for you.</p>
<p>The structure of the Angular project. </p>
<p>So the first folder we have here is the e2e folder. And this is where we write end to end tests for our application.</p>
<p>We have of course node modules and this is where you store all the third party libraries that our application may depend upon.</p>
<p>Also we have the source folder and this is where we have the actual source code of our application.</p>
<p>We have this app folder where inside there are module and a component .</p>
<p>We have these assets folder where you store the static assets of our application . </p>
<p>We have this environment folder and this is where we store configuration settings for different environments . </p>
<p>Also inside the source folder, we have an index.html file that contains our Angular application. Here we don&#39;t have any references to a script or a stylesheet. These references will be dynamically inserted into this page.</p>
<p>We have the main file which is a typescript file and this is basically the starting point of our application. </p>
<p>We have this polyfills file. Polyfills file basically imports some scripts that are required for running Angular. </p>
<p>Also we have styles.css file and this is where we add the global styles for our application and also each page or each component can have its own styles.</p>
<p>We have editorconfig . So this is where you store settings .</p>
<p>The other file here is TSconfig which has a bunch of settings for your typescript compiler . </p>
<p>Also we have TSlint.jason which includes a number of settings for TSlint . </p>
<p>Also, we have an important files package.jason and gitignor.</p>
<p>So this is the basic structure of an angular project .</p>
<p>Angular CLI uses this tool called a webpack. It gets all our scripts and stylesheets and combines them in a bundle and then modifies that bundle. And this is for optimization. More than that whenever you change one of your file webpack automatically recompile your application and refreshes your bundles.</p>
<p>All that functionality is included and hidden in Angular and works automatically. So you don’t have to even understand what is webpack and how it works . </p>
<p>Using Angular makes your life a lot easier.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
